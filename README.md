Ragraa is a frontend third-party client for [Flex](https://flexstudent.nu.edu.pk/Login), made solely for the purpose of optimizing the user experience on Android.


## Features

*  Log into flex with minimal hassle, only requiring an isolated captcha
*  View previously saved data incase of no connection, or simply not wanting to login again
*  Convey the marks and attendance through clean and easy to read UI
*  Highlight when there has been a change in your marks (after a refresh) and visually guide you to the change
*  Option to hide profile picture for whatever reason you may have
*  GPA Calculator to ease your suffering near the end of the semester. Calculates GPA based on MCA for relative subjects, so the actual grade may vary
*  View, download and share past papers which are kept upto date with the wonderful people over from [here](https://github.com/saleha-muzammil/Academic-Time-Machine/)
*  Gather transcript if it exists

        
## Instructions

Since the app doesn't have access to Flex API, it cannot login without having solved the recaptcha. So you must refresh (which just logs you in again) and solve the captcha that pops up to update your marks/attendance. Also, you have to choose the current semester (only once though, it remembers!) in the login screen.
