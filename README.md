## Ragraa

Ragraa is a frontend third-party client for [Flex](https://flexstudent.nu.edu.pk/Login), made solely for the purpose of optimizing the user experience on Android.

## Features


*  Log into flex with minimal hassle, only requiring an isolated captcha
*  Store credentials locally (if you opt to) 
*  View previously saved data incase of no connection, or simply not wanting to login again
*  Convey the marks and attendance through clean and easy to read UI
*  Highlight when there has been a change in your marks (after a refresh) and visually guide you to the change
*  Give you a panic attack if your attendance falls below 80%
*  Option to hide profile picture for whatever reason you may have
*  GPA Calculator to ease your suffering near the end of the semester. Calculates GPA based on MCA for relative subjects, so the actual grade may vary


## Note

You have to choose the current semester (only once though, it remembers!) in the login screen, because Flex only shows the current semester's marks
The app. Also, the app only exists in dark mode. Fine-tuning the colors in the dark was too much for my eyes, thank you for your understanding.

## Features I'd like to implement

Using this as a notepad incase I happen to forget:
*  Access to pastpapers through a database 
*  Show currently happening events (Email -> Database -> App) \[In hindsight, I realize how utterly useless this would be and have chosen to not think about it\]
